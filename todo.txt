## CHAT CONTEXT AUDIT FINDINGS (2025-01-15)

### CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. **Frontend Context Loss** - useChat hook doesn't load existing conversation history, context lost on refresh
2. **Backend Context Issues** - Regular `/stream` endpoint ignores conversation history, only `/agent-stream` works correctly  
3. **API Confusion** - Two endpoints but only agent one uses context properly
4. **Context Flow Problems** - Messages saved to DB but LLM service has no conversation history support

### FIXES NEEDED:
1. **Frontend** - Load conversation history when conversation_id provided, persist across refreshes
2. **Backend** - Add conversation history support to LLM model, pass context to query extraction
3. **Context Continuity** - Ensure all conversation messages included in context, implement proper context window management
